                        <p> I decided to use the Latin Rhythm Dance Club as inspiration for my website. I am an active member
                            of the club and currently serve as social media chair for the executive board. During one of
                            our eboard meetings we were talking about how we do not have an updated website and I proposed
                            that I could work this as my project 3 for my web and mobile class. They all agreed and were
                            excited about the website.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Three factors that I feel were really done well were:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                The navigation bar looks really clean and it shows the active links and works properly.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The images on the slider are top notch and adds an unique touch to the website.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The footer's content is very thorough and also has music playlists for the interested people.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p> I feel like the design of the website is A-level work. The User Interface feels very modern and intuitive.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Two factors that I think can use improvement:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                The content could have been more descriptive and explicit.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I could have added some more additional content to the website to make it more informational.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>
                            Extra Work:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>

                            <li> The images on the lesson and events section contain css image rollover effects. </li>
                            <li> There's a jQuery Images Slider used at the beginning for easier image viewing and scrolling.</li>
                            <li> A script for the text which has fadeIn Animations that makes it look more interactive.
                            <li> A script to specify which element is active on the navbar to indicate user what portion of
                                    the site he is navigating. </li>
