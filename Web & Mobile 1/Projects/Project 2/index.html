        <h3> Origins of the Internet </h3>
        <p>
            The internet was developed in the United States by the "United States Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency" (DARPA). It was first connected in October, 1969, and was called ARPANET. The World Wide Web was created at CERN in Switzerland in 1990 by a British (UK) man named Tim Berners-Lee.
Today, people can pay money to access the internet from internet service providers. Some services on the Internet cost nothing to use. Sometimes the people who offer these free services use advertising to make money from them. The alternative (other) name, "net" came from "inter(net)".

        <h3> Origins of the World Wide Web </h3>
        <p>
            The World Wide Web ("WWW" or "The Web") is the part of the Internet that contains websites and webpages. It was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland. Sir Tim Berners-Lee created a new webpage called HTML. Websites are composed of pages linked by hypertext links. They are all written in the HTML page.
The World Wide Web is used to describe HTML webpages that are part of the Internet. In order to see the World Wide Web one needs a computer, and a modem. One also needs a connection to the Internet.

        <h3> Differences </h3>
        <p>
            The Web is just one of the ways that information can be disseminated over the Internet. The Internet, not the Web, is also used for email, which relies on SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), FTP (File Transfer Protocol), network protocols such as SSH (secure shell for cryptographic connections.) and Telnet, that allows users to connect to other computers on the same network . So the Web is just a portion of the Internet, albeit a large portion, but the two terms are not synonymous and should not be confused.
            So another way to think about it is to say the Internet is composed of the machines, hardware and data; and the World Wide Web is what brings this technology to life.
