		<strong> Vannevar Bush </strong> (March 11, 1890 - June 28, 1974) was an American engineer, inventor and science administrator.
		 He is also known in engineering for his work on analog computers, for founding Raytheon, and for the memex, a hypothetical adjustable
		  microfilm viewer with a structure analogous to that of hypertext.		  In 1945, Bush published the essay "As We May Think" in which he
		   predicted that "wholly new forms of encyclopedias will appear, ready made with a mesh of associative trails running through them, ready
		    to be dropped into the memex and there amplified". The memex influenced generations of computer scientists, who drew inspiration from its
			 vision of the future. He was chiefly responsible for the movement that led to the creation of the National Science Foundation.

		<br><br><strong> Douglas Carl Engelbart </strong> (January 30, 1925 – July 2, 2013) was an American engineer and inventor, and an early computer and Internet 
		pioneer. He is best known for his work on founding the field of human–computer interaction, particularly while at his Augmentation Research
		 Center Lab in SRI International, which resulted in creation of the computer mouse, and the development of hypertext, networked computers, 
		 and precursors to graphical user interfaces. These were demonstrated at The Mother of All Demos in 1968. Engelbart's Law, the observation 
		 that the intrinsic rate of human performance is exponential, is named after his contributions to this amazing discovery.

		<br><br><strong> Theodor Holm Nelson </strong> (June 17, 1937 – Present) is an American sociologist, philosopher, and pioneer of information
		 technology. He coined the terms "hypertext" and "hypermedia" in 1963 and published it in 1965. He also is credited with first use of the
		  words transclusion, virtuality, intertwingularity and teledildonics. The main thrust of his work has been to make computers easily 
		  accessible to ordinary people. Nelson founded Project Xanadu in 1960, with the goal of creating a computer network with a simple user
		   interface. The effort is documented in his 1974 book Computer Lib / Dream Machines and the 1981 Literary Machines. Much of his adult
		    life has been devoted to working on Xanadu and advocating for it.

		<br><br><strong> Steven Paul Jobs </strong> (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was a co-founder and CEO of Apple Inc. He was the 
		Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Pixar Animation Studios until it was bought by The Walt Disney Company. He was the largest shareholder
		 at Disney and a member of Disney's Board of Directors. He was seen as a leading figure in both the computer and entertainment industries.
		  Jobs and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak are widely recognized as pioneers of the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s.
		  In August 2011, Jobs resigned, and was appointed Chairman of the board of Apple. He served in that position until he died. Jobs died at the age of 56 on
		   October 5, 2011. He had pancreatic cancer and died because the tumour had metastasised.

		  co-founder Steve Jobs. Wozniak single-handedly developed the 1976 Apple I, which was the computer that launched Apple. He primarily designed
		   the 1977 Apple II, while Jobs oversaw the development of its unusual case and Rod Holt developed the unique power supply.Wozniak left Apple
		    in the 1980s, but still owns Apple stock. He has founded several other Silicon Valley companies. Wozniak holds the patent for the microcomputer.

		<strong> Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee </strong> (June 8, 1955 - Present)  is an English computer scientist, best known
		 as the inventor of the World Wide Web. He made a proposal for an information management system in March 1989, and he implemented the first
		  successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet in mid-November the same year.
		Berners-Lee is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which oversees the continued development of the Web. He is also the founder of 
		the World Wide Web Foundation and is a senior researcher and holder of the founders chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence 
		Laboratory (CSAIL). He is a director of the Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI),and a member of the advisory board of the MIT Center for 
		Collective Intelligence. In 2011, he was named as a member of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation.

		   where the maintainer collected reviews posted by members. In 1993 he produced a web interface to this database, one of the earliest web 
		   sites in the UK.

		<br><br><strong> Robert Elliot Kahn </strong> (December 23, 1938 - Present) is an American electrical engineer, who, along with Vint Cerf,
		 invented the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP), the fundamental communication protocols at the heart of
		  the Internet. While working on a satellite packet network project, he came up with the initial ideas for what later became the
		   Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which was intended as a replacement for an earlier network protocol, NCP, used in the ARPANET.
		    Vint Cerf joined him on the project in the spring of 1973, and together they completed an early version of TCP.
		    Later, it was separated into two separate layers, with the more basic functions being moved to the Internet Protocol (IP).
			 The two together are usually referred to as TCP/IP, and form part of the basis for the modern Internet.
