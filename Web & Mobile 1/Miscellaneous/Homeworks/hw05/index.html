		<h2>About Me</h2>

		<p>Hi! I'm a second year student from the Dominican Republic, where I was born and raised.
		I'm currently pursuing a degree on Software Engineering. I love playing basketball and latin dancing.</p>

		<p>I enrolled into this class cause I find the mobile app industry really interesting and exciting.
		I'm currently looking to start a Mobile Development Minor and this course is a requirement for it,
		so hopefully this class will provide me a headstart into it. I would love to work for google in the future,
		especially in the Android Department.</p>
