              <h3>Discovery of the New World</h3>
              <p>The island of Hispaniola, which the Dominican Republic currently shares with Haiti, was originally discovered by
                Christopher Columbus on December 5th, 1492. He was sent by the Spanish Monarchs initially on the search of India
                and its clamored spices. His search of India made him believe that the native taíno he encountered were actually
                “Indios” as they are also denominated throughout the island’s history. They first settled the eastern part of the country,
                currently Dominican territory, on January 4th, 1493 when Columbus and his crew marveled at a headland that they named Monte Cristi
                or “Mountain of Christ”. That mountain, El Morro, forms part of the current city of Monte Cristi.</p>

              <p>Continuing his journey from Monte Cristi, Columbus and his crew traveled east towards the north coast of the island landing on Samana
                 Bay on January 6th. In his second trip to America, Columbus established the first European city of the new world, La Isabela, where the
                 present city of Puerto Plata. Years after, Bartholomew Columbus founded the city of Santo Domingo, the oldest permanent European settlement
                 of the new world.</p>

              <h3>The French's arrival</h3>
              <p>Eventually, the population’s growth decreased due to the Spaniards conquest of other islands. Due to the Treaty of Ryswick
                 in 1697, Spain granted the western third of the island to France and kept the eastern side. The island ended up split in two
                 different colonies: the Spanish Santo Domingo and the French Saint-Domingue. Eventually in 1795, France ended up gaining control
                 of the complete island but that didn’t last long due to the Haitian Revolution and their proclamation of independence in 1803.
                 In 1809, the French government handed over the remaining territory back to Spain.</p>

              <h3>Haitians occupation and Dominican Indepence</h3>
              <p>On December 1st, 1821, a group led by lieutenant governor José Núñez de Cáceres declared independence from Spain. This new country
                 that was formed was named Estado Independiente del Haití Español ("Independent State of Spanish Haiti"), but it was short lived as
                 on February 9th, 1822, the Haitian army occupied their territory and remained for 22 years. </p>
              <p>Juan Pablo Duarte, a liberal thinker and writer founded La Trinitaria, a secret society to fight for Dominican independence. Duarte,
                 along with founding fathers Ramón Matías Mella and Francisco del Rosario Sánchez fought against the Haitian and ended their occupation
                 on February 27th, 1844, when the inhabitants of the eastern part of the Hispaniola made a new country named República Dominicana.
                 From 1861 to 1865, Spain regained control of their territory until the Dominicans again fought for their independence during the
                 Restoration War. The country underwent several tyrannical regimes from presidents such as Pedro Santana, Buenaventura Baez, Ulises Heureaux, etc.</p>

              <h3>Dictatorship and Political Instability</h3>
              <p>Due to the political chaos, the country was occupied by the United States from 1916 to 1924. In 1930, Rafael Trujillo led a political
                 revolution where Horacio Vasquez’ government was overthrown . Trujillo was a discriminatory, cruel and merciless dictator, ordering the
                 murdering of thousands of persons by his secret service, among them a Haitian Genocide, where thousands of Haitians living on Dominican
                 territory were murdered. A group of insurgents inspired by the acts of the three Mirabal sisters, who were violently murdered by Trujillo’s orders,
                 successfully plotted an attempt to murder Trujillo on the May 30th, 1961. </p>
              <p>After the death of Trujillo, Juan Bosch, a democrat candidate,  was elected in 1962 and became, in 1963, the first elected president since 1930.
                 But was Bosch was in power for only seven months, which led to a political chaos and thus a civil war between those that wanted Bosch back on power
                 and those that were opposed to him. The United States intervened in order to avoid what they feared would be a Communist Regime. </p>

              <p>In 1966, Joaquín Balaguer would be elected president and would hold power for most of the remainder of the century until Leonel Fernandez got
                 elected on 1996 and on 2004. He was then succeeded by current president, Danilo Medina, who is leading to the Dominican Republic to one of the
                  most rapid growing economies of the Caribbean and a period of political stability.</p>
