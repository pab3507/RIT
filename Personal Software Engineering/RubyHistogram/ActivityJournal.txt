SWEN-250 Activity Reflection

Name: Mois√©s Lora

================================================================
Start
Estimated Time	2 H
Plan:
Read through the string manipulation documentation on Ruby and then look
at how maps and arrays are utilized in Ruby. 

Complete
Actual Time	2 H 30 MM
Observations:
It was tough working all of this out because Ruby is a very different 
language and handles concepts very differently than other languages.
But after understanding how the Ruby Syntax worked it was simpler than
I expected.

(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
