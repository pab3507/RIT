================================================================
Query 1: Find all the information on all the catchers (position 2) in the database
Estimated Time	HH 15MM
Plan: Look up who the select works and where works
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	HH 10MM
Observations: have to use select *
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


================================================================
Query 2: Find the name and age of all pitchers (position 1) on the Rays
Estimated Time	HH 10MM
Plan: implement select and where for multiple fields
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	HH 5MM
Observations: use select plus name of the columns and AND for the where
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


================================================================
Query 3: Find the name, number, and team of all outfielders (positions 7 through 9) who are 25 years old or younger
Estimated Time	HH 10MM
Plan: Look up how to use the where with multiple fields and using comparison operators
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	HH 35MM
Observations: Had to try multiple things but finally got the IN working along with the greater or equal operator.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


================================================================
Query 4: Find the name and number of all infielders (positions 3 through 6) on the Red Sox
Estimated Time	HH 20MM
Plan:Implement the syntax to work for positions 3 thru 6
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	HH 10MM
Observations: This was a combination of query 2 and 3 and didnt take as much time as I expected.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


================================================================
Query 5: Find the name, number, and team of all pitchers who are over 30 years old
Estimated Time	HH 25MM
Plan: Look at the previous queries done and implement into this one
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	HH 10MM
Observations: This was very similar to query 3, except with a single position and the greater operator.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
