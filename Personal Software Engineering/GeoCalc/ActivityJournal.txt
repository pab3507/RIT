================================================================
Start activity 1 -- complete and test the Line class in line.rb
Estimated Time	HH 30MM
Plan: Look how to initialize classes in Ruby and implement a line's length
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	HH 15MM
Observations: initializing ended up being pretty simple, and the line's length
was just the distance formula
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


================================================================

Start activity 2 -- complete and test the Circle class in circle.rb
Estimated Time	HH 20MM
Plan: Look up how to use the Math library for the use of PI in Ruby and how
to initialize the circles values
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	HH 45MM
Observations: The Math Library was pretty easy to implement but the circle's 
radius required some more effort because it utilized Line's length method.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)


================================================================

Start activity 3 -- complete and test the Rectangle class in rectangle.rb
Estimated Time	HH 20MM
Plan: Brainstorm how to calculate rectangle's methods such as height, width, perimeter, etc.
(Order of implementation, testing approach, etc.)

Complete
Actual Time	HH 15MM
Observations: Ended up being fairly simple with just regular calculations for the methods
required.
(Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.)
